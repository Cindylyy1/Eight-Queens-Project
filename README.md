# Eight-Queens-Project
This Java project tackles the Eight Queens Problem on a 15x15 chessboard. '0's represent empty spaces, '1's denote queens. The algorithm iteratively places queens, ensuring no conflicts. If conflicts arise or no valid moves exist, the board resets.

Features: 
Places eight queen chess pieces on a 15x15 board 
Uses an algorithm that finds any conflicts 
Resets the board if there no valid move exist
